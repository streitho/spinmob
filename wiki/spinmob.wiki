#summary A quick overview of spinmob's functions and libraries.

== Introduction ==

Most functions in spinmob are self-documented, and said documentation will automatically pop up in pyshell, allowing you to browse functions and learn about them on the fly. In this section, however I will attempt to describe all of them with a few words for reference.

== Spinmob Sub-Modules ==

|| constants || a list of some common scientific constants. ||
|| [data data] || access to the standard() data class and data loading functions. ||
|| [dialogs dialogs] || a few plug-and-play file dialog functions ||
|| [fun fun] || various random functions for dealing with arrays, strings, and non-plot-related nonsense ||
|| math || some common scipy math functions like sin(), cos(), exp(), etc... ||
|| [models models] || various model classes I've used for the fit routine. See the `_`models.py for examples of how to implement your own model function from the base class. ||
|| [plot plot] || several quick and useful automated plotting functions ||
|| [tweaks plot.tweaks] || a bunch of functions for manipulating pylab plots. Try ubertidy() and set_all_line_attributes(). Or try shift() to make waterfall plots. Or try gui_colormap() for manipulating color/image plots. There's a lot in here. ||


== Spinmob Functions ==

|| figure()            || (convenience) pylab's figure() function ||
|| fit()               || interactive fitting routine, handling multiple data files and [models models]. At the fit prompt, type "help" for more info.  ||
|| gca()               || (convenience) pylab's gca() ("get current axes") function ||
|| gcf()               || (convenience) pylab's gcf() ("get current figure") function ||
|| plot.data()         || simple function to plot arrays of data ||
|| plot.files()        || simple function to analyze and plot multiple data files using the [data data].standard() class ||
|| plot.function()     || simple function to numerically plot a function of one variable ||
|| plot.image()        || makes an image plot from data files ||
|| plot.surface_data() || makes an image plot from data arrays ||
|| plot.surface_function() || makes an image plot from a function in 2 variables ||
|| printer()           || quick function to print the current figure. ||

== Other Objects ==

|| prefs || a dictionary-like object that keeps track of your local system's preferences. Your main interaction with this object is to set prefs["print_command"] to a valid print command so that printer() will work (I use gsprint.exe on windows, a part of ghostscript). ||

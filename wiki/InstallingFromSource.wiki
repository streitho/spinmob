The source code for spinmob is constantly improving. If you find a bug in one of the official distributions, it may have already been fixed. This page outlines how to install the latest version of spinmob using an SVN client.

== Windows ==

 * Download and install [http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ TortoiseSVN]
 * Create a folder named "spinmob" in your [SitePackages site-packages] directory.
 * Right click this new spinmob folder, select "SVN Checkout..."
 * In the box labeled "URL of repository" enter http://spinmob.googlecode.com/svn/trunk
 * Click OK.

All done. Any time you want to update, simply right-click this folder and select "SVN Update".

== Linux & Mac ==

 * Find your [SitePackages site-packages] directory.
 * In the terminal window use the command
{{{
svn checkout http://spinmob.googlecode.com/svn/trunk /path/to/site-packages/spinmob
}}}
 * Then whenever you want to update spinmob to the latest version, use
{{{
svn update /path/to/site-packages/spinmob
}}}
 * It is possible to turn these commands into clickable scripts or aliased terminal commands. Somehow...
 * I don't know what is the best SVN client. I remember at one point I used a clunky one in linux, but it worked.

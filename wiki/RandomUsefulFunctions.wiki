#summary Other miscellaneous functions, listed roughly in order of how useful I personally find them.

Once you have [GettingStarted explored spinmob] a little, it is helpful to use the pyshell auto-complete to see what functions are available and just try them out. They aren't perfect; some are extremely useful and some of them are total hacks, but at one point or another I've needed them, sometimes out of complete ignorance. :)

There are a few commonly-used-by-me functions in the global spinmob namespace, along with some categories (assuming, in [GettingStarted] we've already typed "import spinmob as s") and extra functions:

|| s.constants   || list of physical constants, in mks       ||     
|| s.data        || databox data handler (see [GettingStarted]) ||  
|| s.dialogs     || file dialogs for selecting one or many files ||
|| s.fit()       || interactive data fitting using string functions (easier) ||
|| s.fit_model() || interactive data fitting using the model class (harder but more flexible) ||
|| s.fun         || a hodgepodge of miscellaneous functions (string manipulation, array handling, etc) ||
|| s.models      || location of some example models I use to fit data ||
|| s.prefs       || global preferences object, for settings like the last used directory etc... ||
|| s.printer()   || prints the current figure (provided you have a valid s.prefs['print_command'] string defined. I use gsprint.exe that came with ghostscript/gsview ||

more to come.

#summary The spinmob guide to printing.

= Printing =

Quickly printing formatted data with adequate blank space to take notes, draw pictures, etc. is a big strength of spinmob.  Setting up printing can be a bit tricky.  


== Windows 7 ==

On Windows 7 first download and install [http://www.ghostscript.com/ Ghostscript] and [http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/gsview/ gsview].

Second, generate a Windows ".bat" file, with contents similar to:
{{{
C:\"Program Files"\Ghostgum\gsview\gsprint.exe -color %1
if errorlevel 1 pause
}}}
This obviously depends on the location of gsprint.exe.  This .bat file is good for default printing.  Label it "Win7_Print_To_Default.bat"

Save this file somewhere, for example:
{{{
"C:Lab\Programming\Python\Win7_Print_to_Default.bat"
}}}
Finally, in python save the key value pair to your spinmob preferences:
{{{
s.prefs['print_command']='C:Lab\\Programming\\Python\\Win7_Print_to_Default.bat'
}}}
Note, at this time I don't know how to account for special characters, such as spaces in the command above.  Now hopefully you can run 
{{{
s.printer()
}}} 
to generate hard copies of nicely formatted figures.

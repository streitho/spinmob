#summary A few things to try right away.

= Install and Run =

(1) Install [http://www.python.org/ python], [http://www.scipy.org scipy and numpy], [http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net matplotlib], and [http://www.wxpython.org wxpython] (telling it to generate the tool scripts during install if possible). Then drop the spinmob source folder into your [SitePackages python site-packages] directory.

(2) [PyShell Start pyshell].

(3) >>> import spinmob

= A Few Commands to Hit the Ground Running =

== Plotting ==

|| >>> spinmob.plot_data([1,2,3],[1,5,4]) || Generate a simple data plot ||
|| >>> spinmob.plot_data([[1,2,3],[1,2,3]], [[1,3,2],[4,1,3]]) || Generate a few data lines. ||
|| >>> spinmob.plot_function(spinmob.math.sin) || Plot sin(x) ||
|| >>> spinmob.plot_function([spinmob.math.sin, spinmob.math.cos]) || Plot sin(x) and cos(x) ||
|| >>> spinmob.tweaks.auto_zoom() || Auto-scale the data. ||
|| >>> spinmob.tweaks.ubertidy() || Prepare the plot for presentation. (I save as ps and use [http://www.inkscape.org/ Inkscape]) ||

== Data Analysis ==

The most useful part of this project is the data importing and analysis library. I need to write the documentation for the types of data files it can read and include a test file before I tackle this section.

If you want to play with the class, start by doing something like this:

>>> d = spinmob.data.standard()

>>> d.load_file()

to point an instance of this class at a data file. Then try d[0] to view the 0th column, d.columns, for the full list, d.header for the header values, d.c(), d.h(), and d.get_new_column('2*c(0)', 'my column') to manipulate the data. You can also save the manipulated data with d.save_file()

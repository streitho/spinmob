# Introduction #

Spinmob is a scientific data analysis and plotting package I wrote during graduate school (and then made less stupid over the past 10 years) to move past expensive, buggy, poorly-documented programs like Origin, weaker programs like Excel. In the end, this plus Inkscape were all I needed to go from data to publication.

The main features are

  * forgiving and user-friendly data class for importing and crunching a wide variety of ASCII data files
  * heaps of higher-level automated plotting functionality based on matplotlib
  * interactive fitting routines based on scipy and
  * freedom and open-sourcenessdom.

Plus I threw in a bunch of random functions I found useful in dealing with strings and data.

... where it has been SIGNIFICANTLY improved. Especially the fitter!
